Jare - Java Business Rule Engine

Pentaho PDI Plugin Step

Regular Plugin Step for the Pentaho Data Integration Tool (PDI).

The Rule Engine is a java based tool to check data from a file or database
against rules which are defined in XML files. Rules are reusable, avoid
duplication and thus are a positive factor for quality. Rules can be connected
with and/or logic to a complex data validation task.

Because the rules are defined externally, the transformation or job does not
need to change when the business rules change. The business rules can be defined
and maintained by the business user. Increases the transparency of the logic to
the user as it is no more embedded in IT code.

The rule engine can be used to check data for consistency, correctness and quality
or for filtering data. Based on the results of the rules, onme or multiple actions
may be executed.

Rules can be defined in one or multiple rules files in one folder or can be zipped
into an archive that the rule engine uses.

A web application is available to easily define complex rules and actions and group
them into projects. This allows to quickly and easily define groups of rules
defining the logic for different projects.

Read the documentation PDF file for detailed information.

The business rule engine is published as open source. Sources are available
on github.
