Relase history for the Business Rule Maintenance Tool

last update: Uwe Geercken, November 2014

version 1.4
===========
- Added code to handle groups (roles). Groups can be defined and users can be added/removed from (multiple) groups.
  A project belongs to one group. If a user belongs to the projects group or if he/she is in the admin group, he/she
  can modify the project; otherwise the user has read-only access to the project, rules, actions, etc. A project that
  is private can only be seen and modified by the users in the group that the project belongs to or users being in
  the admin group or the user that created the project.
